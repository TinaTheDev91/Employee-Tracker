# Employee-Tracker
Employee tracking using a SQL database

## Description

This application was created to show my ability to utilize a SQL database. At this point in time, my title is Data Conversion Specialist and I do data migration via SQL queries. SQL and data in general has always been one of my strong-suits, so being able to apply it to a new endeavor is extremely satisfying. 

This project has the ability to update employee information via the user's CLI. It features 7 actions, including the ability to view 3 tables (department, employee and role), add data to those 3 tables, as well as update the role of an existing employee. Each table features at least one foreign primary key field that forms a direct relationship to another table - enabling a more cohesive mapping of the database.

## Installation

This project is only accessible via your CLI. To access, please clone the repository, direct yourself to the location that the repository is housed, update the SQL credentials within the config/connection.js file to your own and then run 'node index.js' to use.

## Usage

When using the application, you should see something similar to the screenshot below. The screenshot shows the options that the program will offer to the user. If you're not seeing something similar when you use the application, please email me at TinaTheDev91@gmail.com.
